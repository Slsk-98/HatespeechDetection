In this study, we have proposed a novel approach to classify Twitter content into three distinct categories: hate, neutral, and offensive. Our method offers a comprehensive framework for categorizing tweets, leveraging both shallow and deep learning models. Six shallow learning models and two deep learning models were employed, with the 1D CNN deep learning model demonstrating superior performance based on the F1 score metric. Additionally, two dimensionality reduction techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and TF-IDF, were utilized to streamline data processing and feature extraction. However, limiting the analysis to only the first principal component resulted in less optimal outcomes compared to using the entire dataset.

Among the three classes, offensive tweets were most accurately identified across all models, consistently yielding the highest F1 score. Conversely, the neutral class exhibited relatively poorer performance, indicating challenges in distinguishing neutral tweets from hate and offensive content. While the F1 score for the neutral class was not significantly low, it was comparatively lower than the other two categories. To enhance understanding and interpretation, we employed data visualization techniques such as word clouding, which provided insights into the frequency of word occurrences in the tweets. Such visualizations offer a valuable supplement to textual analysis, aiding in the identification of key themes and trends within the dataset.

Moving forward, there are several avenues for future research and improvement. Firstly, exploring advanced deep learning architectures and ensemble techniques could further enhance classification accuracy and robustness. Additionally, incorporating contextual information and sentiment analysis may provide deeper insights into the nuanced nature of Twitter content. Moreover, investigating the impact of incorporating multimedia elements such as images and videos could enrich the classification process, considering their potential to convey information more effectively than text alone. Furthermore, expanding the scope of analysis to encompass other social media platforms and languages would broaden the applicability and generalizability of the classification model.

Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing efforts to combat online hate speech and promote a safer digital environment. By developing an effective classification framework for Twitter content, we aim to empower platforms and policymakers with tools to mitigate the harmful effects of hate speech online. Through continued research and innovation, we strive to advance the field of computational linguistics and contribute to the creation of more inclusive and respectful online communities.
